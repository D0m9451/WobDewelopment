		<p class = bsp> Chichén Itzá[nb 1] (often spelled Chichen Itza in English and traditional Yucatec Maya) Yucatec Maya pronunciationⓘ was a large pre-Columbian city built by the Maya people of the Terminal Classic period. The archeological site is located in Tinúm Municipality, Yucatán State, Mexico.[1]Chichén Itzá was a major focal point in the Northern Maya Lowlands from the Late Classic (c. AD 600–900) through the Terminal Classic (c. AD 800–900) and into the early portion of the Postclassic period (c. AD 900–1200). The site exhibits a multitude of architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes styles of the Northern Maya lowlands. The presence of central Mexican styles was once thought to have been representative of direct migration or even conquest from central Mexico, but most contemporary interpretations view the presence of these non-Maya styles more as the result of cultural diffusion</p>

			<li> On the spring and autumn equinox, the setting sun hits the El Castillo pyramid just right so it looks like a giant shadow snake slithers down the steps to the serpent head statues at the base.
			<li> If you clap your hands in front of the pyramid’s staircase, the echo sounds like a chirping bird — specifically a sacred quetzal.
			<li> They had a ball court where losing could literally mean death. Historians aren’t 100% sure if the winners or losers were sacrificed
			<li> They drank cacao mixed with chili peppers and cornmeal, and served it foamy
			<li> The pyramid has 365 steps (including the top platform) — one for each day of the year
			<li> They tossed valuable items, pottery, and sometimes people into the Cenote Sagrado (basically a big hole) as offerings to the gods. Divers have pulled up gold, jade, and a ton of human remains from it.
			<li> It’s actually several pyramids built on top of each other, like a giant stone nesting doll.
