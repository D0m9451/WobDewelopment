		<p>Christ the Redeemer (Portuguese: Cristo Redentor, standard Brazilian Portuguese: [ˈkɾistu ʁedẽˈtoʁ]) is an Art Deco statue of Jesus in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, created by French-Polish sculptor Paul Landowski and built by Brazilian engineer Heitor da Silva Costa, in collaboration with French engineer Albert Caquot. Romanian sculptor Gheorghe Leonida sculpted the face. Constructed between 1922 and 1931, the statue is 30 metres (98 ft) high, excluding its 8-metre (26 ft) pedestal. The arms stretch 28 metres (92 ft) wide.[1][2] It is made of reinforced concrete and soapstone.[3][4][5] Christ the Redeemer differs considerably from its original design, as the initial plan was a large Christ with a globe in one hand and a cross in the other. Although the project organizers originally accepted the design, it later changed to the statue of today, with the arms spread out wide.</p>

		<ul>
			<li> Christ the Redeemer has no toes carved
			<li> On average, the statue takes 3-5 lightning hits per year. In 2014, a bolt snapped off part of his right thumb
			<li> Original designs had him holding a giant globe in one hand and a cross in the other. The open-arm pose won because it looked more welcoming and was easier to build.Also probably because giant props are a health hazard in lightning country
			<li> Most of the statue was sculpted in Paris, shipped to Brazil in pieces,
			<li> At night or on holidays, it’s lit up in different colors — like pink for breast cancer awareness or green for Earth Hour
