		<p>The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications in China. They were built across the historical northern borders of ancient Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe</p>
		<br>
		<ul>
			<li> In some sections built during the Ming Dynasty, workers mixed sticky rice soup with lime to make an ancient cement so strong that itâ€™s lasted for centuries.
			<li> Legend says that when a worker died during construction, they were buried in the wall.
			<li> Even back then, folks were carving their names into the bricks like ancient bathroom stall etching
			<li> It stretches over 13,000 miles (21,000+ km) if you count all the branches. Walking it end-to-end would take about 18 months nonstop
			<li> Locals sometimes tell kids that the Wall follows the shape of a sleeping dragon across mountains and rivers
