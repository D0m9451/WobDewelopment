		<p class = bsn> The Taj Mahal is a white marble mausoleum in Agra, India, built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife, Mumtaz Mahal. It's considered a masterpiece of Indo-Islamic architecture and one of the most iconic monuments in the world. The complex also includes a mosque, a guest house, and four minarets, all set within a large Mughal garden</p>

			<li> Emperor Shah Jahan built the Taj Mahal as a tomb for his favorite wife Mumtaz Mahal, who died giving birth to their 14th kid
			<li> Legend says Shah Jahan wanted to build a matching black Taj Mahal for himself on the opposite bank of the Yamuna River, connected by a silver bridge. but his son overthrew him before hand
			<li> There’s a rumor Shah Jahan cut off the hands of the artisans so they could never make anything as beautiful again. Historians say it’s most likely made up
			<li> Every dome, arch, garden, and pond is perfectly mirrored. Except for one thing: Shah Jahan’s own tomb, added after his death, which awkwardly throws off the symmetry inside the crypt
