		<p class = bsp> The Colosseum is an elliptical amphitheatre in the centre of the city of Rome, Italy, just east of the Roman Forum. It is the largest ancient amphitheatre ever built, and is still the largest standing amphitheatre in the world, despite its age</p>

		<ul class = bsn>
			<li> Ancient Romans would fill the Colosseum with lions, elephants, crocodiles, and even giraffes just to see what would happen
			<li> With all that animal carnage and sweaty gladiators, the Colosseum reportedly used scented flowers and perfumes to mask the stench
			<li> They once flooded the entire arena to stage mock naval battles
			<li> Shows were free for everyone, but you might also get splattered with blood, trampled in a stampede, or have to dodge a flying ostrich head
			<li> They trained ravens to deliver messages mid-games
			<li> They'd act out myths with actual executions
			<li> They once set a lion and an elephant loose together. The elephant apparently threw the lion accross the arena </li>
